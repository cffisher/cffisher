## Hi 👋
I'm a hobbyist coder who has been working with JavaScript since 2015, starting at age 9. I love exploring music-centric projects.

<!--### 🔭 What I'm Working On
- [Chat-Server](https://github.com/cffisher/Chat-Server) - An experimental Node.js chat server.
- [Requests for Multiplayer Piano](https://multiplayerpiano.net/?c=The%20Request%20Line%20%E2%98%8E%EF%B8%8F) - A jukebox-like piano bot that lets users play from, upload to and search through a collection of MIDI files.

### 🏛️ What I've Worked On
- [EpicOS for Multiplayer Piano](https://github.com/cffisher/EpicOS) - A multi-purpose command-based bot.

- [Crystal FM for Discord](https://cffisher.github.io/t/20220412-crystal-fm/index.html) - A radio-like music bot for voice channels.

- [NMPB++ for Multiplayer Piano](https://cffisher.github.io/t/20250123-nmpb-plus-plus/index.html) - A Node.js MIDI player inspired by Ste-Art's MIDI player bot (NMPB).
